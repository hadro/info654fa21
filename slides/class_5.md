# .center[üíª File Formats üíª]

---
# Let's talk about files

- What is a file?
- What is a file format?
- Magic numbers
- File structures
- Standardization
- Registries

---
# Files

Things that can be
- Open
- Read 
- Changed
- Closed
- Permissions modified

---
# File Formats

We have many different types of files! These are categorized into different formats, with different ways to determine what to do with the data inside the file.

---
# Magic numbers

What separates a file from the rest of the binary landscape?
### Magic numbers!
Magic numbers are sometimes known as file signatures. They are a short string of hexadecimal code that  allow a file to identify itself as a certain type of file.

---
# File structure

- Magic numbers (file signature)
- Header
- Body (or payload)

---
# File standardization

- Outlines all the rules required to follow to have a valid file
- Can be standardized through a standards body (but not required)
- Can be open (anyone can read) or closed (proprietary, only people in a company/organization can access)

---
# Standardization example

A great resource for explaining how a file format is made, by Ross Spencer:

# Images

## JPEG
- came around in the 90s, varying degrees of Compression, very popular

## GIF
- pronounce as you like, not good quality but it can loop
- have become videos now on the web, including giphy.com!

## PNG
- lossless compression, which means its bigger. not very web-optimized but higher quality.
- it also has another layer, transparency!

---
# Images, cont

## SVG
- XML for images (like we saw on the nytimes homepage)
- this is vector-based instead of pixel-based
- Illustrator instead of Photoshop 
- we can view source on this https://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Logo.svg
- raster vs vector https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Bitmap_VS_SVG.svg

## Other formats...
- BMP, TIFF, JPEG2000, RAW

---

## Audio

- WAV (regular, LPCM, BWF)
- limited to 4GB, very high quality stream though
- FLAC

## Video
- containers and codecs (same for audio)
