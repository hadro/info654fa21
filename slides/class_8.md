# Break!

---
Let's start here: 

--
# TIERS OF DATA ACCESS

--
- **Static data**: HTML, XML, flat files, CSV, etc.  

--
- **Flowing data**: via APIs, via http, read and write access  

--
- **Meaningful data**: Linked Data, semantically linked, machine and human readable

# Computers talking to computers

.center[![](img/computer_e-mail.gif)]

- Rules around how computers communicate
- Used as a framework for many computer things! Like for your computer to talk
to your printer.
- In modern-casual terms: Rules for how you can retrieve data from websites ü§ñ

# Computers talking to computers

So APIs are all about computers talking to computers, but they're also an
*abstraction layer* that allows people to easily understand how to get the data
that they need from a computer.

When you query an API (asking it to give you some data), it will always return
data in a specific format. The data itself might change, but the arrangement of
the data will always be the same.

---
# key-value pairs

Like a lot of computer concepts, APIs are composed of *properties and values*

---

## Where have you encountered APIs?

What comes to mind when you think of APIs?  
In what contexts have you heard the term?  
What do people do with these?  

---

# What kinds of APIs would you like to see?

If you could get access to any kind of data in a structured way, what kinds of things would be among your top choices?


---
# Aside: Why are most APIs closed? 

Most APIs with lots of data require you to register, often asking you to sign up for what's called a "developer key" or "access token" or something similar. 

--
## Why? 

What are the various reasons for this?

## An open API playground: IIIF Image API

<https://www.learniiif.org/image-api/playground>

Try the following:
- change "size" to `pct:10` [this means 10% of the original size]
- change "Region" to `full`
- change "Region" to `square`
- Now, refresh the page
- change the third number in "Region" from `799` to `1400`, so the whole string reads `1015,1460,1400,824`
- change "size" to `600,` [don't forget the comma after the 600]
- Now copy the `Requested image url:` just above the image, and paste it into a new tab
- Now try any of the above transformations by editing the URL directly!

# Let's build a GovTrack API query!

What data is this API call returning? What do we see? How could we refine it?

# Linked Data

Sir Tim Berners Lee, from earlier in this semester: 

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt got data on the web as data.‚Äù 

"Documents you read ‚Äì that‚Äôs it.‚Äù

‚ÄúData ‚Äì you can do all kinds of stuff with it.‚Äù

# FIVE STAR DATA

<https://5stardata.info/en/>

1. Open License
2. Structured data
3. Open format
4. Use URIs
5. Get useful data back!


---

## Three Rules: 

1. HTTP names -- not just documents, but for things the documents are about.
2. Get important information back
3. Define relationships


---

## It's all about relationships

Often called TRIPLES

**SUBJECT, OBJECT, PREDICATE**

--

Josh, IIIF, is employee of  
Josh, Rhea, is the parent of  
Josh, Andrew, is the sibling of  

--

IIIF, Josh, is employer of  
Rhea, Josh, is the child of  
Andrew, Josh, is the sibling of 

--

Now, to make this proper Linked Data, you must use URIs for each element of the triple.

# Linked Jazz

An example:

Linked Jazz relationships (an amazing Pratt project!)
