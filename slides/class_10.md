# Readings

---
class: middle, center

# Break!


---

# Privacy

--

Let's start here:

## **What is privacy?**

--

What does it mean in the context of technology we've covered in this class?

---

# Privacy

--
Is privacy good?

--

If so, why?

--

Why does privacy matter?

Why is it important?


---
# Privacy

Is there a right to privacy?


--
At least in the US, it's not actually enshrined in the constitution or amendments.  

--
So how have we derived our current notions around privacy?


--

It ends up being implied -- but not explicit! -- in two major amendments:

- Fourth Amendment (against search and seizure)
- Fourteenth Amendment (equal protection under the law)


---

# Metafilter on privacy

https://www.metafilter.com/113517/Global-Village-People

> I have sometimes wondered whether the word "privacy" will sound to our grandchildren the way the word "honor" sounds to us.

> "There was a time when people thought this was a real thing with immense value, which, once lost, was lost forever, and so they would go to incredible lengths to preserve it. People were weird back then."

# Data analysis

--

Quick review (think back to structured data week):

- CSV: Comma Separated Values

Very often delivered via API as well, most often via JSON

---

# Data analysis

## Types of data

- Categorical
  - Nominal (factor)
      - Binary/logical
  - Ordinal
- Numerical
  - Integers/decimals
  - Date/time
  - Interval

---
# Data analysis

## Types of data

Other ways of describing data categories:
Continous vs discrete


---

# Data analysis

## Three example files to work within
- **NYC 311 Data sample (from 2018)**
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadro/info654fa20/master/data/311_sample.csv
- **The Metropolitan Museum of Art open data release**
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadro/info654fa20/master/data/Met_sample.csv
- **Squirrel Census**
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadro/info654fa20/master/data/Squirrel_sample.csv

Open one of these data sample links in your own browser

--

After you've looked at it for a minute in a web browser, save one or both of the files to your computer

---

# Exploratory data analysis

Try opening it up on your computer (should open in Excel, or Numbers, or LibreOffice; if no program will open it don't worry, just follow my screen)

- Filter rows
- Start sorting

--
- Check length of data (how much are we dealing with?)
- Check how many columns of variables there are
- Are there column headings? If so, do they make obvious sense?
- Get a sense for what kind of responses are in each columns
  - is the data categorical or freeform with a column?
  - Does it fall within a certain range if it's numerical?
  - Are there a lot of blank fields in a column?

---

# Moving from data to conclusion

What are the kinds of questions we can answer with the following:
- Open Data from the NYC 311 Data collection?
- Open Data from the Met Museum?
- The Squirrel census data?

--

What are the kinds of stories we can tell with those data sets?

---

# Interlude

## Bias in data!

- Who is collecting the data?
- Who or what is represented in the data?
- What safeguards are in place?
- How could this data be used against someone?
- How could a person or a group of people be misrepresented by this data?


---

# Visualization

Great vocabulary of chart types, and ways to use data viz to convey meaning:

https://github.com/ft-interactive/chart-doctor/raw/master/visual-vocabulary/Visual-vocabulary.pdf


![](./img/viz-screen-shot.png)

---

# Visualization

Some of the most powerful:
- Distribution (particularly histogram)
- Change Over Time (generally known as time-series plots)
- Magnitude

## Grammar of graphics and plots

The world of data viz and analysis very much has it's own grammar and vocabulary; here are some of the initial basic terms (and synonyms) you are likely to encounter.

N.B. Different systems do this differently! For example, GGPlot in the R programming language uses a different vocabulary than Plotly in Python, but accomplishes the same thing.

- Geometry or plot type
  - Histogram
  - Scatter
  - Bar
  - Line
- Traces, plots, data element, variable
  - Dimensions
- Axes
- Filtering

---

# Examples from Life Experience

Here are just two examples of data analysis and data viz Josh has done in real-life situations:

- [Analysis of the Greene Hill Food Co-op usage patterns](https://hadro.github.io/ghfc/ghfc_psfc_report)
  - Written using R programming language and RMarkdown, with a viz tool called [GGPlot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
- [HathiTrust Usage Analysis](https://hadro.github.io/hathi_analysis/analysis.html)
  - Written using Python and Jupyter Notebooks

---

# Visualization

## Exploratory data viz

Let's try using the data we examined above, in a tool call Plot.ly

https://plot.ly/create/

Example Data links again:
- [311 Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadro/info654fa20/master/data/311_sample.csv)
- [Met Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadro/info654fa20/master/data/Met_sample.csv)
- [Squirrel Census data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadro/info654fa20/master/data/Squirrel_sample.csv)


- At top left, click "Import"
- select "By URL" Tab, and paste in URL to one of the CSVs above
- Add a "trace" in the left pane, and try out different plot types with different variable combinations
  - Tip: Scatter, Bar, and Histogram will be the easiest until you have a deeper understanding of the contours of the data

Asking again:
What are the kinds of stories we can tell with the following:
- Open Data from the Met Museum?
- Open Data from the NYC 311 Data collection?
- The Squirrel census data?

# Exploring and Visualizing other data sets


Good example sets to play with:

- 311 Data (full data going back to 2010, warning this is huge!): https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9
- 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census (!): https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw

- Popular data sets: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?sortBy=most_accessed&utf8=%E2%9C%93

- Great projects!: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/projects/


---

# Exploring NYC Open Data Portal

Has a built-in exploratory data viz tool!

--

It's not perfect, but it can help get us started.

---

# Exploring NYC Open Data Portal

- Explore the ["Popular Data Sets"](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?limitTo=datasets&q=&sortBy=most_accessed&utf8=%E2%9C%93)
- Pick one and click into it
- At the top, click "Visualize..." and then "Create Visualization" (not "Open in Plotly", because these will mostly be too big to export to Plotly well)
- From there, begin by picking "Demensions" from the drop-down on the left
- After trying a few of those, try picking one of the different plot in the icons above the viz window (try to pick one with a green "recommended" view)
